\section{Turing dynamical systems} \label{tds}

When talking about $\ell^2$-betti-numbers, we are also talking about groups.
So in order to link Turing machines to $\ell^2$-betti-numbers, we certainly need some additional structure on Turing machines.
At the very least, the group in question should be found somewhere inside the Turing machine.
Therefore we introduce Turing dynamical systems, which are somewhat similar to Turing machines but add the required additional structure.
The link between these two concepts will be discussed in detail in later chapters.
