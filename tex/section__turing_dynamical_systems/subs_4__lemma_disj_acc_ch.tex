\begin{Lemma}
	\label{tds:lemma_disj_acc_ch:lemma}
	Consider a Turing dynamical system with fundamental values $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$.
	If the TDS has disjoint accepting chains, then \IM{\Omega_1 = \Omega_2}.
\end{Lemma}

\proof

	Because of disjoint accepting chains, there is a set $M \subseteq \F_1$ such that $\mu(M) = \mu(\F_1)$ and $T^\infty$ is injective on $M$.

	Also we have that $T^\infty = T^\infty \circ T$ and hence $T$ is injective on $M$ and $T^\infty$ is injective on $T(M)$.
	By Lemma \ref{tds:lemma_tx_measurable:lemma} then, $\mu(T(M)) = \mu(M) = \mu(\F_1) = \Omega_1$.

	Inductively, we get that $T$ is injective on $T^{i-1}(M)$ for every $i \in \N^+$ and hence $T^i$ is injective on $M$ and $\mu(T^i(M)) = \Omega_1$.

	Clearly, 
	\begin{align*}
		T^i(M) \xrightarrow{i \to \infty} T^\infty(F_1) = F_2
	\end{align*}
	 and hence
	\begin{align*}
		\Omega_1 = \mu(T^i(M)) \xrightarrow{i \to \infty} \mu(F_2) = \Omega_2
	\end{align*}
	which concludes the proof.

\endproof
