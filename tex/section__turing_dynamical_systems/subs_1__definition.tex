\begin{Definition}
	A \emph{Turing dynamical system (TDS) } consists of the following data:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{a probability measure space $(X,\mu)$}
		\item{a discrete countable topological group $\Gamma$}
		\item{a measure preserving right group action $\rho : X \curvearrowleft \Gamma$ (write $\gamma \bullet x$ for $\rho(\gamma)(x)$)}
		\item{a division $X = \dot\bigcup_{i=1}^n X_i$ into finitely many disjoint measurable subsets}
		\item{disjoint sets $J_I, J_R, J_A \subseteq \{1,...,n\}$}
		\item{a map $\{1,...,n\} \to \Gamma, i \mapsto \gamma_i$ such that $\gamma_j = 1~\forall j \in J_R \cup J_A$}
	\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
From this we can derive the \emph{initial set} $I = \bigcup_{i\in J_I} X_i$, the accepting set $A = \bigcup_{i \in J_A} X_i$ and the rejecting set $R = \bigcup_{i \in J_R} X_i$ as well as the \emph{Turing map}
\begin{align*}
	T_X : X &\to X \\
	x &\mapsto \gamma_i \bullet x&\text{, for}~x \in X_i
\end{align*}
Note how most of a TDS can be recovered from this derived information.
We lose the measure $\mu$ (but only in so far as $\mu$ is known to be a probability measure which $T_X$ preserves),
those elements of $\Gamma$ that are no $\gamma_i$
and the exact division into $X_i$, but the mapping to the $\gamma_i$ is still known.
