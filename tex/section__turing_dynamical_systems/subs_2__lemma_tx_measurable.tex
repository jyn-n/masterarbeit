\begin{Lemma} \label{tds:lemma_tx_measurable:lemma}
	The Turing map $T$ of any TDS is measurable and measure contracting, that is for any measurable $U \subseteq X$ we have that $T(U)$ and $T^{-1}(U)$ are both measurable and $\mu(T(U)) \leq \mu(U)$.
\end{Lemma}
\proof
Let $U \subseteq X$ be measurable. We have
\begin{align*}
	T^{-1}(U) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \gamma_i^{-1} \bullet U
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
	T(U) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n T(U \cap X_i) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \gamma_i \bullet (U \cap X_i)
\end{align*}
both of which are measurable as all the $X_i$ are measureable and the $\gamma_i$ are measure preserving and thus
\begin{align*}
	&\mu(T(U)) \\
	= &\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^n \gamma_i \bullet (U \cap X_i)) \\
	\leq &\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(\gamma_i \bullet (U \cap X_i)) \\
	= &\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(U \cap X_i) \\
	= &\mu(U)
\end{align*}
\endproof

Similar to Turing machines, we define $T^\infty(x):=T_X^k(x)$, if $T^k(x)=T^{k+1}(x)$. Thus we also get the notions of accepting, rejecting and stopping for TDS.
That is, a TDS accepts $x \in X$, if $T^\infty(x) \in A$,
rejects it if $T^\infty(x) \in R$ 
and stops for $x$, if it either accepts or rejects it.
We say a TDS is \emph{foolproof} (or \emph{stops on any configuration}, if it stops for all $x \in X$ except for some null set.
