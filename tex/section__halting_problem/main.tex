\section{The halting problem}

Now that we know what Turing machines are, we should discuss their capabilities and restrictions.
The Turing machine is a theoretical concept that governs modern day computers. That is, any computational problem that can be solved by a computer can also be solved by a Turing machine.
The Church-Turing thesis, as formulated for example in \cite{tur36}, further proposes that Turing machines can solve any problem that is solvable by a human being.
When investigating the limitations of Turing machines we might in fact be investigating the limitations of our own minds.
A problem that is not decidable is first and foremost not solvable by a Turing machine, which means there is no known way of solving the problem in an automated fashion, but it might be that we ourselves are conceptually unable to solve such a problem.

Finding a problem to be unsolvable is perhaps not the most satisfactory solution, but nonetheless a result which should probably be regarded as definitive for now.

To understand what it means for a problem to be unsolvable is the aim of this chapter.
A broader discussion on the topic may be found e.g. in \cite{sip06}.
