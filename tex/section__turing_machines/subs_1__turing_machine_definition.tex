\subsection{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
	A \emph{Turing machine} $M$ consists of the following data:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{some $n \in \N$}, the \emph{number of tapes}
		\item{a finite set $A$ called the \emph{alphabet}, its elements are called \emph{symbols}}
		\item{a finite set $S$ called the \emph{states}}
		\item{a map $T_{write}: A^n \times S \to A^n$}
		\item{a map $T_{state}: A^n \times S \to S$}
		\item{a map $T_{direction}: A^n \times S \to D^n$ where $D := \{-1,0,1\} \subseteq \Z$}
		\item{distinct states $\{\INI,\ACC,\REJ\} \subseteq S$}
		\item{a symbol $\EMP \in A$}
	\end{itemize}
	and satisfies
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{$\INI \notin T_{state}(A^n \times S)$}
		\item{$(T_{write} \times T_{state} \times T_{direction}) (x,s) = (x,s,0) ~\text{for every}~ x \in A^n , s \in \STOPS$}
	\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
When talking about Turing machines we will always use the denominations as in the definition.
For example the alphabet will always be called $A$ and $A$ will usually be the alphabet of some Turing machine.
If it is not obvious to which Turing machine $A$ belongs, we clarify by writing $A(M)$.

An element $((a_{i,j})_{i \in \Z, j \in \{1,...,n\}},s) \in (A^\Z)^n \times S =: C$ is called a \emph{configuration} of $M$. The $(a_{*,j}) \in A^\Z$ are called the \emph{tapes}.
For improved readibility we will leave out the indices of $a$ whenever possible.

A configuration is said to be \emph{finite}, if only finitely many entries on each tape are not \EMP.

A configuration $(a,s) \in C$ is called an \emph{initial configuration}, if all of the following are true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{$(a,s)$ is finite}
	\item{$s = \INI$}
	\item{$a_{z,i} = \EMP~\forall z < 0, i \in \{1,...,n\}$}
\end{itemize}
The sets of finite and initial configurations are denoted by $FC$ and $IC$ respectively.

We will now define the \emph{transition map} which shall be a map on the configurations $C$ which in a sense combines the behaviour of $T_{write}$, $T_{state}$ and $T_{direction}$.
To this end we first extend the domains of $T_{write}$, $T_{state}$ and $T_{direction}$ to $C$:
Let
\begin{align*}
	\pr_0: (A^\Z)^n &\to A^n \\
	(\pr_0(a))_i &:= a_{0,i}~\forall i \in \{1,...,n\}
\end{align*}
Now define
\begin{align*}
	T_{write}^\prime &:= T_{write} \circ (\pr_0 \times \id_S) \\
	T_{state}^\prime &:= T_{state} \circ (\pr_0 \times \id_S) \\
	T_{direction}^\prime &:= T_{direction} \circ (\pr_0 \times \id_S)
\end{align*}
Further let
\begin{align*}
	T_{write}^{\prime\prime}: (A^\Z)^n \times S &\to (A^\Z)^n \\
	(a,s) &\mapsto T_{write}^{\prime\prime}(a,s) \\
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
	(T_{write}^{\prime\prime}(a,s))_{z,i} =
	\begin{cases}
		(T_{write}^\prime(a,s))_i &\text{, if}~z = 0 \\
		a_{z,i} &\text{, if}~z \neq 0
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
As it should become clear from the context which map is being referred to, we will just say $T_{write}$ instead of $T_{write}^{\prime\prime}$
and $T_{state}$ instead of $T_{state}^{\prime}$
and the same for $T_{direction}$.

Further we require the map $T_{tape}$:
Given some tapes and a state, it regards the symbols at position 0 of every tape and changes them according to the map $T_{write}$.
Then it shifts those new tapes according to $T_{direction}$ but to determine the direction it uses the unchanged symbols.

More precisely, let
\begin{align*}
	\sh: A^\Z \times \Z &\to A^\Z \\
	(a,z) &\mapsto \sh(a,z)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
	\sh_i(a,z) = a_{i+z}
\end{align*}
Now let
\begin{align*}
	T_{shift}: (A^\Z)^n \times C &\to (A^\Z)^n \\
	(b,c) &\mapsto ( \sh(b_{*,1},(T_{direction}(c))_1) , ... , \sh(b_{*,n},(T_{direction}(c))_n) )
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
	T_{tape}: C &\to (A^\Z)^n \\
	c &\mapsto T_{shift} (T_{write} (c) , c)
\end{align*}

Finally we can define the \emph{transition map} $T:C\to C$ nicely:
\begin{align*}
	T = T_{tape} \times T_{state}
\end{align*}
\begin{Remark}
	In the literature one often finds Turing machines to be defined in a way such that configurations are always finite. In our case, the broader definition will allow us to easily adjust to the concept of Turing dynamical systems later on.
	But nevertheless our Turing machines still satisfy $T(FC) \subseteq FC$, that is, we can restrict our definition to finite configurations and still have a well defined notion of Turing machines, which even happens to coincide with the one from standard literature.
\end{Remark}

If for some $c \in C$ and $k \in \N$ we have that $T^k(c) = T^{k+1}(c)$ we define $T^\infty(c) := T^k(c)$ and leave it undefined otherwise.

We also abuse notation a bit and define
\begin{align*}
	T_{state}^0: C &\to S \\
	(a,s) &\mapsto s
\end{align*}
as well as
\begin{align*}
	T_{tape}^0: C &\to (A^\Z)^n \\
	(a,s) &\mapsto a
\end{align*}
and also
\begin{align*}
	T_{tape}^k := T_{tape}^0 \circ T^k
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
	T_{state}^k := T_{state}^0 \circ T^k
\end{align*}
for all $k \in \N \cup \{\infty\}$.
To justify this notation, observe that $T^k = T_{tape}^k \times T_{state}^k$.
