As we have seen, \emph{kernel-over-$\Z[(\Z_2 \wr \Z)^2]$} is not decidable.
To put this statement into context, we will consider a class of groups for which \emph{kernel-over-$\Z[G]$} actually is decidable and see which properties $(\Z_2 \wr \Z)^2$ is lacking.
Hence we learn something about the sharpness of said class of groups.

\begin{Definition}
	Let $G$ be a finitely presented group with generators $g_1,...,g_n$.
	The \emph{word problem (for groups)} now asks whether a given word represents the unit element of $G$. That is, for
	\begin{align*}
		v_1,...,v_k \in \{g_1,g_1^{-1},...,g_n,g_n^{-1}\}
	\end{align*}
	is $v_1 \cdot ... \cdot v_k = 1$?
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
	\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The word problem is not decidable in general. %TODO citation needed
		\item If the word problem is decidable for some presentation of a group $G$, then it is decidable for any presentation of $G$.
			Hence we may say that the word problem is or is not decidable for $G$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Remark}

\begin{Example}
	The group $\Z_2 \wr \Z$ is generated by
	\begin{align*}
		x &:= (1_0,0) ~\text{and} \\
		y &:= (0,1)
	\end{align*}
	where $1_i \in \Z_2^\Z$ is the element such that
	\begin{align*}
		 (1_i)_j = \begin{cases} 1~ &\text{, if $i = j$} \\ 0~ &\text{, otherwise} \end{cases}
	\end{align*}

	To see this remember that the multiplication in $\Z_2 \wr \Z ~\cong~ \Z_2^{\oplus \Z} \rtimes \Z$ is defined by
	\begin{align*}
		(a,b) \cdot (1_i,d) = (a + 1_{b+i}, b+d)
	\end{align*}
	for $b,d \in \Z$ and $a \in \Z_2^{\oplus \Z}$.

	The word problem for this group is decidable.
\end{Example}
\proof
%TODO direkt TM bauen
	Let $v_1,...,v_n \in \{x,y,y^{-1}\}$.

	Clearly, $v_1 \cdot ... \cdot v_n$ is of the form $(*,0)$, if and only if $y$ and $y^{-1}$ occur the same number of times among the $v_i$.\footnotemark
	\footnotetext{This actually means solving the word problem for $\Z$. But for free groups as well as cyclic groups, the word problem clearly is decidable and $\Z$ is both.}

	For the first component, we can regard any element of $\Z_2^{\oplus \Z}$ as a finite subset of $\Z$.
	Then the action of an element of $\Z$ (which is generated by $y$) can be seen as a (computable!) bijection on $\Z$.
	Thus deciding whether the first component of $v_1 \cdot ... \cdot v_n$ is zero boils down to computing the exclusive disjunction of some finite sets, which clearly is doable.
\endproof

\begin{Definition}
	A group $G$ is called a \emph{BFS-group}, if there is a bound in the size of finite subgroups of $G$.
	That is there is an $n \in \N$ such that for every $H \leq G$ we have $|H| \leq n$ or $|H| = \infty$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
	A BFS-group is in a sense the next best thing to a torsion free group.
	In fact, a group is torsion free, if and only if the size of its finite subgroups is bounded by 1.
\end{Remark}

%TODO pro-examples
\begin{Example}
	$\Z_2 \wr \Z$ is not a BFS-group.
\end{Example}
\proof
	$\Z_2 \wr \Z$ contains $\Z_2^{\oplus \Z}$ as a subgroup, which in turn contains $\Z_2^n$ for every $n \in \N$. But $|\Z_2^n| = 2^n$ which is finite and larger than $n$ for every $n \in \N$.
\endproof

The following theorem gives us some groups for which \emph{kernel-over-$\Z[G]$} is decidable.
However, as we have learned, $(\Z_2 \wr \Z)^2$ is not such a group.
In particular, there are non-BFS-groups such that \emph{kernel-over-$\Z[G]$} is not decidable.

\begin{Theorem}
	\label{decidable_zero_divisors:theorem}
	Let $G$ be a finitely presented sofic BFS-group with decidable word problem for which the Atiyah-conjecture holds (i.e. there is some $k \in \N$ for every $G$-CW-complex the $n$'th \ltwo-betti-number is a multiple of $\frac1k$).

	Then \emph{kernel-over-$\Z[G]$} (compare chapter \ref{the_zero_divisor_problem:main_theorem}) is decidable.
\end{Theorem}
For the proof, let us quote Lemma 7 from \cite{gra14-2}:
\begin{Lemma}
		\label{decidable_zero_divisors:lemma}
	Let $G$ be a sofic group.

%TODO auflisten
	Then there is a computable map $h: \N_+ \to \N_+$ such that for every self-adjoint, positive $T \in \Z[G]$ and $n \in \N$ such that at most $n$ coefficients in $T$ are non-zero and each coefficient is absolutely less than $n$, then
	\begin{align*}
		| \dim_{vN} \ker T - \tr_{vN}(1 - \frac{T}{\|T\|_1})^{h(n)} | < \frac{1}{n}
	\end{align*}
	where $\|T\|_1$ is the sum of the absolutes of all coefficients.
\end{Lemma}
%TODO eigenvalues < 1

%TODO tr_vN leichter zu berechnen als dim_vN
\proof [Proof of Theorem \ref{decidable_zero_divisors:theorem}]
	Let $T \in \Z[G]$.
	The Atiyah-conjecture provides a $k \in \N$ such that $\dim_{vN} \ker T \in \{0, \frac{1}{k},\frac{2}{k},...\}$. %TODO is k computable? Has to come from BFS
	In particular, $\dim_{vN} \ker T \neq 0 \Rightarrow \dim_{vN} \ker T \geq \frac1k$.

	Now consider the map $f:\N \to \R, m \mapsto \tr_{vN}(1 - \frac{T}{\|T\|_1})^{h(3m)}$ ($h$ from Lemma \ref{decidable_zero_divisors:lemma}).
	This map is computable since in order to compute the von-Neumann-trace, we only need to compute the coefficients of $\frac{T}{\|T\|_1})^{h(3m)}$, which means we only need to solve the word problem for $G$, which is possible as per requirements of the theorem.
%TODO ausfuehren

	By Lemma \ref{decidable_zero_divisors:lemma} we have $|f(k) - \dim_{vN} \ker T| < \frac{1}{3k}$. But this means
	\begin{align*}
		& \dim_{vN} \ker T \neq 0 \\
		\iff~& \dim_{vN} \ker T \geq \frac1k \\
		\iff~& f(k) > \frac{1}{3k}
	\end{align*}
	which is decidable. For the last step, realize that if $f(k) \leq \frac{1}{3k}$, then $|f(k) - \frac1k| \geq \frac{1}{3k}$.
\endproof
