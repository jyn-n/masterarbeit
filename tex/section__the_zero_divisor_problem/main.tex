\section{The Zero-divisor problem}

In this chapter we prove what may be considered the most important theorem of this work.
To do so we use a theorem from \L{}ukasz Grabowski which connects Turing dynamical systems to \ltwo-betti-numbers.
This theorem makes a statement about the pontryagin dual of a group which is associated to the TDS.
Therefore we briefly introduce pontryagin duality to an extent that allows us to apply the theorem to our context.
For a broader understanding of pontryagin duality see for example \cite{fol95}.
