\section{Turning a Turing machine into a TDS} \label{tm_to_tds}

We will now see that the concept of Turing dynamical systems is a generalization of Turing machines.
We will consider a readonly Turing machine and construct a Turing dynamical system that keeps all of the information from the Turing machine.
A similar transition is possible for Turing machines that are not readonly but readonlyness allows for a much more direct approach and is therefore preferred.
