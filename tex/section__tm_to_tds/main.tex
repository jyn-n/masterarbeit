\section{Turning a Turing machine into a TDS} \label{tm_to_tds}

We will now see that the concept of Turing dynamical systems is a generalization of Turing machines.
We will consider a readonly Turing machine and construct a Turing dynamical system that preserves all information of the Turing machine.
